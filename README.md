-In order to make the repository work, follow the CGAL installation guide: https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/windows.html
-Use the second installation approach, since currently vcpkg does not work when installing CGAL.
-Once Boost and CGAL are both installed, and the environmental variables are set up, open the .sln file with Visual Studio.
-Finally, right click on the project Fast_VW, and select "Set as Startup Project".
-Now by pressing F5, the solution should build and run.
